I had a meeting with a friend of mine who worked at Nike at the time, and I was just talking to him about all my frustrations with the labels that were sold after me, the managers, the people, all the real and fake. And, how my phone won’t stop ringin'. I went to the studio right after, 16yrold invited me to the studio with Day Trip, and we all started making this beat and then we made the beat. I was like, “Alright I’m gonna rap on the joint.” And I rapped on it, and then I, my friend Mo Bamba, who was a draft pick, asked me to put his name in the song or somethin'. But, then I started freestylin' but I was freestylin' about all the people callin' me, and I guess it was just what I was talkin' about, and I was frustrated about and I made this one-take freestyle about Mo Bamba and how I’m like Mo Bamba, like I’m a athlete. I was being recruited the same way as athletes do. So, that’s why I compared it.
