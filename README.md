### Assignment 0
 Consists of a dynamic array, circular dynamic array, stack, and queue class. The stack class is built upon the dynamic array class, while the queue class is built upon the circular dynamic array class. The language of implementation is Portable C99. Each of the four classes need to be implemented in its own module.
 The classes are generic. Meaning that the type of the value stored in a node object will not be specified by the any of the classes. The user of the array, stack, and queue classes can determine the type of value stored in these data structures.
